The second step refines de json, adding interesting datapoints to the code needed.

- We filter out data that is incomplete, or missing some data, such as the elo of users and 
- Get basic statistics about competitors to then save it and load it later on, things such as average of ELO, are what's important
- As the progam is reading the json we will have to look for different name of users.
- Re-read everything to save the json file with the names of users
